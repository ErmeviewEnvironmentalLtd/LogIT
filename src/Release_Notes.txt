- This is a minor release to update the database before a major upgrade from
  the SHIP library is introduced in the next version. Next version will 
  possibly be an unstable release so database compatibility with this one will
  make it possible to switch back if needed.
- Updated database to version 8.
- Added TEF column to RUN table.
