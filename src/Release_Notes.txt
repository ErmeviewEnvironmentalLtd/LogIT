- Added IefResolver module. This can now be found under the Tools menu. It
  tries to automatically convert the paths in an .ief file from it's old
  location to the new one. It may not work if the folder structure has been
  changed since the ief file has been setup. It works by updating the root
  folder for the paths to match the new location.
  E.g. if the model folders are now placed in C:\consultancy\mymodels\projectname\model
  and the paths have O:\something\oldplace\model the IefResolver will change
  the portion of the path before model to match the new location. It's a bit
  cleverer than that, but you get it. 
- Bug fix for a problem in loading the results caused by an edge case that
  was returning an instance of SomeFile instead of the results path string.
- Made horizontal scrolling in tables a bit easier to use by allowing by
  pixel movement instead of by item.
-
- Summary of old release (0.4.4) for those that didn't get it.
- Updated to latest release of TmacToolsLibrary. This fixes a couple
  of small bugs but doesn't have a big impact.
- Updated the look and feel and fixed some issues with the layouts.
- Fixed bug in database versioning that meant an older version of the 
  database didn't realised it needed to update.
  THIS MEANS THAT LOG DATABASES WILL NEED UPDATING.
- Fixed bug in multiple model loader file list. When dragging more
  than one file it was deleting items in the row. Multiple selection
  is now disabled. To remove multiple entries a checkbox can be
  selected.
- Added release notes dialog on startup after new version installed. 
  Launches a dialog to show version updates to user.
- Added feature to automatically check for new version on startup.
- Added current model load tab to settings. It will now remember if
  you were using the single or multiple model load tab last time.
- Fixed an issue with reading results and check files with the 
  model extractor tool. Now deals with absolute paths.
  This has also been applied to the logger. It will now record the 
  absolute path of the results location in the log if different
  from the main model directory.
- Improved path display in model extractor input/output textboxes and
  the summary output display. They are now normalised for the OS and
  can be copied and pasted directly into Explorer.
- Fixed a few more things in the way error handling is dealt with.
  This still needs some work though. Sorry :(
