- [Bugfix] Error in 1D only load.
- [Bugfix] Issue with creating new log database.
-
- <em>Main relase notes below:</em>
- [Feature] Added Run Summary widget (Beta). You can load a Tuflow .tlf file and 
  display the current status and key outputs summarised in a table and graph.
  You can also add a log entry into the summary table automatically by
  right clicking on the RUN table entry and selecting Add to Run Summary.
- [Feature] Added mass balance and run status columns to the to RUN table in
  the log database. These will be automatically added to the log by reading
  the '_TUFLOW Simulations.log' file when loading a model, if it is complete. If
  the run hasn't finished at the time of loading they will not be entered, but
  can be added at any time by using the right click menu in the RUN table and
  selecting Update Status, or update the whole table under the Settings >> 
  Tools menu.
- IMPORTANT: The new column's will require updating your databases.
- [BugFix] The Exit menu item and some keyboard shortcuts were broken. I think
  these have all been fixed now.
- [Feature] Added lots of new keyboard shortcuts. You can find out most of them
  from the Help tab of by hovering over the buttons / looking at the menu items.
  A nonobvious one is the use of F5 to reload the current row in the Run
  Summary Tool table.
- Implemented a proper standardised interface for all all widgets (tabs). This
  has unfortunately meant that the settings loading has been broken and an
  update will reset settings (not the log database). It will help make it more
  stable in the future and easier to maintain though.
- Increased and improved the testing framework. Coverage is now pretty good.
  All new features are being added by default and I'm making my way slowly
  through the rest of the code base. Most of mission critical stuff is now
  tested, at least rudimentally.
- Improvements to the way that settings are stored. It should make them a lot
  more stable and less prone to break when updated...except this once when they
  will definitely completely break. There should be a bit more consitency in 
  how file paths are remembered now. e.g. if you load an .ief file in one tool
  the same directory will be used in another next time.
- Lots, and lots and lots of bug fixes.
