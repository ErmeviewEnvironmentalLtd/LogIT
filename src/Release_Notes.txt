- Updated to latest release of TmacToolsLibrary. This fixes a couple
  of small bugs but doesn't have a big impact.
- Updated the look and feel and fixed some issues with the layouts.
- Fixed bug in database versioning that meant an older version of the 
  database didn't realised it needed to update.
  THIS MEANS THAT LOG DATABASES WILL NEED UPDATING.
- Fixed bug in multiple model loader file list. When dragging more
  than one file it was deleting items in the row. Multiple selection
  is now disabled. To remove multiple entries a checkbox can be
  selected.
- Added release notes dialog on startup after new version installed. 
  Launches a dialog to show version updates to user.
- Added feature to automatically check for new version on startup.
- Added current model load tab to settings. It will now remember if
  you were using the single or multiple model load tab last time.
- Fixed an issue with reading results and check files with the 
  model extractor tool. Now deals with absolute paths.
- Fixed a few more things in the way error handling is dealt with.
  This still needs some work though. Sorry :(
