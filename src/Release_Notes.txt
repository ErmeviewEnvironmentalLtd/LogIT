- Bugfix for loading a 1D only model when 2D scheme is set to None. Previously
  this wasn't checked and if a tcf file was found in the ief file it was loaded
  into the database. This was happening even if the use of 2d was deactivated.
  The active status is now checked and only 1D components are loaded if it is
  not active.
- Set 2d results location back to being the folder only and not folder plus
  the tcf filename. This is because results locations can hold additional
  sub area outputs etc as well.
- Started to implement some unit tests to try and get better at catching
  a few of the regression that seem to be prevailant in the last few releases.
  This will also help to identify and solve some of the problems with the
  slightly unhelpful error messages that are being launched.
