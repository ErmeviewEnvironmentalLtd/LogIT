- Big change to single model load user interface. Got rid of all of the 
  ugly tables and replaced it with a navigable tree. Same colour schemes
  etc still apply.
- Moved New Entry tab into a separate widget to attempt to reduce the amount
  of code in the LogIT.py.
- Fixed bug in new version downloader copy settings process. It should now
  copy settings across properly.
- Added additional message to new version downloader to let the user know if
  it has been successfull and instruct on what to do next.
