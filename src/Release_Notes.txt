- Improved reporting of missing model files (.tgc/.tbc, etc) from loading
  a tuflow model. There was an issue in the SHIP library and in the way logit
  was trying to report these. They should now be listed when not found.
- Moved the LogBuilder functionality from module functions to a class to make
  error handling and reporting of warnings a bit cleaner and easier to maintain.
- Fixed some bugs in the Ief Resolver. These include an oversight in finding
  the correct reference file for the .tcf or .dat file used to work out the
  main containing foler. If there was another file with the same name higher in
  the directory it would pick this one. It now uses a slightly more clever
  approach to rank the liklehood of any particular file being the correct one.
  Improvements also made to the second pass attempt at locating files.
- Some improvements in error handling in the model logger. These are still not
  perfect, but they should be a bit better than they were. Tests are in place
  that can be updated to help improve this when problems are reported.
- Added a lot more unittests. These now include some checks for the 
  Ief Resolver and the Model Extractor widgets. Although the coverage is not 
  perfect at the moment most of the basic functionality of the model loaders
  and outputs is there. Further tests will be added when bugs are identified. 
  These should help to avoid as many regressions in the future.
