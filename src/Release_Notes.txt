 - [BUGFIX] Ief files with paths containing =.
 - [BUGFIX] Run status updates for tcf paths containing run options placeholders.
 - Updated to SHIP version 0.2.4.
 - Previous release notes below:
 - New Database setup people. We are officially moving up to 1.0!
 - MASSIVE rewrite of basically everything. 
 - NOTE THIS HAS MEANT THAT IT CANNOT BE BACKWARD COMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS 
   VERSION OF THE DATABASE. If you have a database from a version of LogIT
   that is less than 1.0.0 you will need to use an older version. 
 - The way to many tableitis has been dealt with and we are now down to only
   three tabs on the View Log, which is nice. These are the run tab, a catch
   all selection tab for the model files and a query tab for everything else.
 - There is a completely different database setup that uses a new library
   to help manage querying and dealing with the tables. This should make the
   DB code much easier to maintain and will make it possible for logit to
   keep getting better.
 - Lots of lovely stuff:
 - Advanced querying of the database to find out basically whatever you want
   more to be added to this in the future.
 - You can hide/show column headers in the run table so you only need to look
   at the info that you think will be useful.
 - Right click menus for common queries on both the Run table and the model 
   tables. These allow you to quickly see the model files of other files
   associated with them. The query form will be setup automatically for these
   as well so you can see how it works.
 - All the other bits and pieces that you know and love are still there :)
