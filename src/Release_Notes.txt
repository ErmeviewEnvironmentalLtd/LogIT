- Bugfix for Ief Resolver and Model loader.
-
- Main release notes available below:
- Big change to single model load user interface. Got rid of all of the 
  ugly tables and replaced it with a navigable tree. Same colour schemes
  etc still apply.
- Moved New Entry tab into a separate widget to attempt to reduce the amount
  of code in the LogIT.py.
- Fixed bug in new version downloader copy settings process. It should now
  copy settings across properly.
- Added additional message to new version downloader to let the user know if
  it has been successfull and instruct on what to do next.
- Some more work on fixing result/check/log paths so that they load properly. 
  There is probably still some work to do here.
- Update Model Extractor tool. Now copes much better with the different 
  formats for check file paths.
