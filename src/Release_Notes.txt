- [Feature] Added multiple model selection to the model extractor tool. You
  can now load as many models at once as you want for extracting. There are
  still the same issues with materials and bc databse files as before. I'm
  hoping to sort this out in the SHIP library soon.
- Changes to layouts. The existing layouts have been causing some problems on
  high-res screens. I've tried to make a compromise with how they function.
  This means they are little less tidy on normal screens, but hopefull will
  actually be viewable in 4k now.
