- Mostly same as last release but with a big fix for a problem in
  loading the results.
- Updated to latest release of TmacToolsLibrary. This fixes a couple
  of small bugs but doesn't have a big impact.
- Updated the look and feel and fixed some issues with the layouts.
- Fixed bug in database versioning that meant an older version of the 
  database didn't realised it needed to update.
  THIS MEANS THAT LOG DATABASES WILL NEED UPDATING.
- Fixed bug in multiple model loader file list. When dragging more
  than one file it was deleting items in the row. Multiple selection
  is now disabled. To remove multiple entries a checkbox can be
  selected.
- Added release notes dialog on startup after new version installed. 
  Launches a dialog to show version updates to user.
- Added feature to automatically check for new version on startup.
- Added current model load tab to settings. It will now remember if
  you were using the single or multiple model load tab last time.
- Fixed an issue with reading results and check files with the 
  model extractor tool. Now deals with absolute paths.
  This has also been applied to the logger. It will now record the 
  absolute path of the results location in the log if different
  from the main model directory.
- Improved path display in model extractor input/output textboxes and
  the summary output display. They are now normalised for the OS and
  can be copied and pasted directly into Explorer.
- Fixed a few more things in the way error handling is dealt with.
  This still needs some work though. Sorry :(
