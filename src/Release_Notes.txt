- [Feature] Implemented the Custom Query tab on the Query widget. This allows
  for bespoke user SQL scripts to be written for accessing data in the
  database. It does not except any commands that will edit or delete any of
  the data.
- [Feature] Added syntax highlighting to the Custom Query tab. Inputs will
  be highlighted for SQL terms, table names and table fields to help 
  identify errors in the scripts. There is also an overview of the database
  model available on the rightclick menu in the script window.
- [Feature] Added saving and loading of logit sql scripts to file on the
  Custom Query tab.
- Tidied a few things up and sorted out the code a little.
