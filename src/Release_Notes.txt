- Updated database version to v21 YOU WILL NEED TO UPDATE DATABASE.
- Added Initial Conditions column on RUN table.
- Added Ied table and with support for recording IED files.
- [Feature] support for database updates and migrations. This was broken when
  the database was updated to the new version, but is now included again.
- [Bugfix] Better support for event/scenario logic. 
- Currently, when a file containing event logic is loaded into the database 
  it will include only the files that fall within the provided run options. 
  When that files is loaded with different run options it will not be added a 
  second time and the additional files are missed. Fix allows for additional 
  files to be added and those files are referenced against a specific run as 
  well as the model file for identification when querying.
- Changed the Scenario vals box text to "Run Options" for consistency.
